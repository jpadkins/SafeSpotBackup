		<h1>About the Safespot Team</h1>
		<p>SafeSpot gives users the ability to find a location where they will feel safe, such as police stations, fire stations, government buildings, or specified addresses. Additionally, the user can check summaries of crime in a specific location to judge their safety before entering the area. If the user does find themselves in a situation where they feel threatened, then they can use the app to get directions to their nearest safe place. The overall goal is safety, anytime and anywhere.</p>
